Vyne is a platform for automating integration between data sources \(API's, databases, streaming sources, etc\).  It provides intelligent on-the-fly integrations, that automatically upgrade themselves as your services update. 

Vyne uses rich semantic schemas to infer how data across your organisation links together.  Using this, Vyne is able to automate the integration and discovery of data.
